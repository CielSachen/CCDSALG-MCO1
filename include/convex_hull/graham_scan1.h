/**
 * @brief Scans points to find the points that would make up the convex hull using a slower sorting algorithm.
 * @details This locates the point with the lowest y-coordinate, and lowest x-coordinate if multiple, and sets it as the
 * anchor point. The points are sorted, using the selection sort algorithm. Then, they are checked one-by-one for the
 * direction of the angle they formed. All points, starting from the anchor point, that have a counter-clockwise
 * direction form the convex hull.
 * @param[in,out] points The points to scan through. This will be mutated to be sorted.
 * @param point_count The number of points to scan through.
 * @param[out] convex_set_points The resulting points from the created convex set.
 * @param[out] convex_set_point_count The number of resulting points from the created convex set.
 * @return Whether the scan was completed.
